## **Objective** ##

This is an excercise in demonstrating how you can do some basic data exploration, data cleaning and simple analytics on a text file using Linux commands. The csv source file used is the Loan risk prediction dataset and is found on Kaggle at this location: [Kaggle Loan risk prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ganjerlawrence/loan-risk-prediction-dataset).

## **Highlights** ##

* Total sales, total profit andt total items sold has been on a slight decline from 2015 to 2017.
* Average sales transactions per day went up in 2017.
* More than half of deliveries are late in all 3 years.
* The top selling product department in 2015 and 2017 is *Fan Shop*, 2nd is *Apparel*.
* The top selling product category in 2015 and 2017 is *Fishing*, 2nd is *Cleats*.
* Most customer types were consumers vs. corporate or home office.
* Each year, most sales transactions are in progress and not completed.
* Late deliveries did not have a greater impact on completed sales transactions.
* Since September of 2017, total sales transactions have been increased while total items sold have decreased dramatically.
  This indicates that less items are being purchased more frequently towards the end of 2017.
